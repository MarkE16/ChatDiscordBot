# Discord Chat Bot
This is a bot that you can use in [Discord](https://discord.com/) servers.

It can be used for chatting, sort of. Currently, it has commands for utility, while it does have a few commands that support the bot's actual usage.
This bot is still in development, so new features may be added soon.

## Command Prefix
In order to use the commands, you must use the '.' character before typing out the actual command.

## Commands
Currently, there are not much commands. However, there are still some to use that can make this bot fun.

.help - This sends the whole list of commands.  
.ping - "Pong!"  
.say - Repeats the user's entered message.  
.mute - Mutes a user.  
.tempmute - Temporarily mutes a user.  
.unmute - Unmutes a user.  
.report - Reports a user to people with the Administrator role. (This currently doesn't work 100% at the moment! It sends the reports to me as of right now.)  
.filterword - Adds a word to a list of words that you don't want allowed.  
.clearfilter - Clears your list of filtered words.
